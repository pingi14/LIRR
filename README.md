# Long Island Railroad OTP Analysis

## Project Background
In our continuous effort to understand and enhance the performance of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), weâ€™ve conducted a series of data-driven analysis. These delve into various aspects of on-time performance (OTP), assessing trends, pinpointing weaknesses and identifying opportunities for improvement.

## Executive Summary
The application of SQL queries to analyse the on-time performance data of the MTA and LIRR has provided valuable insights into the operational strengths and areas for improvement within the network. The applied detailed analysis help in making data-informed decisions to enhance the reliability and efficiency of rail services, ultimately benefiting daily commuters and the organisation.

## Technical Project Information
Data Source: https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-LIRR-On-Time-Performance-Beginning-2015/6kq9-5ikh/about_data

The data was downloaded from LIRR site as a .csv file containing monthly OTP (On-Time Performance) percentage data from all LIRR Branch Lines between 2015-2024.  SQL was applied to cleans the data and was then visualised via Power BI.  [Please refer to SQL Scripts applied](https://github.com/pingi14/LIRR/blob/main/SQL%20Scripts_v2.pdf)
